# Codable Media Mashup

> A language. A website. An online video editor for the power user.

Codable Media Mashup (CoMM) is both a website and a language used for editing
online videos through a web server. For those of us who don't have the
time or bandwidth to download a bunch of online videos and splice them
into a video mashup, highlights reel, or compilation, CoMM simplifies things.
